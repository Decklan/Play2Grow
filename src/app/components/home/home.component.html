      <p class="text-muted text-left">
        Occupational therapy is a profession dedicated to assisting individuals with 
        varying abilities to develop the skills that support success in the tasks and 
        activities that are part of daily life. Pediatric occupational therapists 
        assist children to engage with others; regulate emotions and behavior; move; 
        play; learn across all environments; and successfully participate in daily 
        tasks such as feeding, dressing, toileting, and sleeping. With extensive 
        background in neurodevelopment, psychology, rehabilitation, and education, 
        occupational therapists are uniquely qualified to take a holistic approach 
        to intervention. Our goal is to support families to develop the individual, 
        environmental and interpersonal supports essential to health and well-being.    
      </p>
    
      <p class="text-muted text-left">
        At Play to Grow Developmental Therapy Services we work closely with children 
        and adults with developmental challenges and their families to support success 
        in the tasks and activities that are most meaningful to them.  We believe that 
        learning occurs throughout the lifespan across multiple environments and within 
        the context of positive, supportive relationships.  As a result occupational 
        therapy takes many forms in the clinic, at home, school, work and in community 
        settings â€“ wherever support is required for learning and integrating new skills. 
        Our goal is to assist you to develop the individual, environmental and interpersonal 
        supports essential to health and well-being.
