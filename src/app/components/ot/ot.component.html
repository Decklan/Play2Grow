  <p class="text-muted text-left">
    Occupational therapy is a profession dedicated to assisting individuals with 
    varying abilities to develop the skills that support success in the tasks and 
    activities that are part of daily life. Pediatric occupational therapists 
    assist children to engage with others; regulate emotions and behavior; move; 
    play; learn across all environments; and successfully participate in daily 
    tasks such as feeding, dressing, toileting, and sleeping. With extensive 
    background in neurodevelopment, psychology, rehabilitation, and education, 
    occupational therapists are uniquely qualified to take a holistic approach 
    to intervention. Our goal is to support families to develop the individual, 
    environmental and interpersonal supports essential to health and well-being.

  <p class="text-muted text-left">
    At Play to Grow Developmental Therapy Services we work closely with children 
    and adults with developmental challenges and their families to support success 
    in the tasks and activities that are most meaningful to them.  We believe that 
    learning occurs throughout the lifespan across multiple environments and within 
    the context of positive, supportive relationships.  As a result occupational 
    therapy takes many forms in the clinic, at home, school, work and in community 
    settings – wherever support is required for learning and integrating new skills. 
    Our goal is to assist you to develop the individual, environmental and interpersonal 
    supports essential to health and well-being.

        <p class="text-muted text-left bg-light bg-secondary">
          Sensory Integration treatment is designed to support an individual's ability to 
          process and integrate sensory information so he or she can interact more comfortably 
          with others; engage more successfully in movement, play, self-care, work, and learning 
          activities; and better regulate social and emotional responses. Treatment is based on 
          a thorough assessment of each person’s sensory-motor skills, and includes activities 
          rich in movement, touch, deep pressure, auditory, and visual information; environmental 
          modifications that support organized integration of sensory information; and a "sensory 
          diet" of daily activities and routines designed to support organization of the nervous 
          system.

        <p class="text-muted text-left bg-light bg-secondary">
          Interactive Metronome is a well-researched, computer-based intervention that 
          focuses on improving processing abilities that affect attention, motor planning 
          and sequencing. Research suggests that individuals who receive interactive 
          metronome treatment show statistically significant changes in attention, 
          organization, motor control, language processing, reading fluency and behavioral 
          control – areas of developpment which are typically challenged in individuals 
          with developmental, learning and attention problems such as ADHD, sensory processing 
          disorders, nonverbal learning disorders, autism, learning disabilities and other 
          related concerns.

        <h3 class="lead text-success"><b>Therapeutic Listening</b></h3>
        <p class="text-muted text-left bg-light bg-secondary">
          Therapeutic Listening Programs use sound in combination with sensory, movement, postural 
          and breath work, and visual activities to support a variety of functional outcomes. All 
          of our senses (touch, movement, smell, taste, hearing and vision) work together to help 
          us understand and interact effectively with our world. In particular, sound combined with 
          movement provides vital information about the orientation of the body in space and time 
          that forms the basis of sensory motor function and perceptual organization. For this reason, 
          listening programs incorporated into a sensory- motor  treatment can result in positive 
          changes in attention, organization of behavior, self-regulation, postural control, 
          coordination of body sides, motor planning, fine and visual-motor skills, social engagement 
          and communication.

        <p class="text-muted text-left bg-light bg-secondary">
          Qiqong has been practiced in China for thousands of years to promote general 
          health and well-being. Qiqong sensory massage is a form of Qiqong practice 
          that has been developed specifically for the needs of children with autism 
          and sensory regulatory disorders that can be simply and effectively provided 
          by parents in the home in approximately 15 to 20 minutes daily with training 
          and support from a qiqong certified therapist. In addition to being a wonderful 
          bonding experience between parent and child, research suggests that daily qiqong 
          massage results in improvements in sensory processing; regulation of sleep, 
          appetite and digestion; emotional regulation, social engagement, language skills, 
          and motor development.
